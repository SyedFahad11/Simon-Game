# Simon Game

Welcome to Simon Game! This is a digital adaptation of the classic Simon electronic game. Simon is a memory game where players have to repeat increasingly long sequences of colors and sounds.

## How to Play
1. **Start:** Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. **Remember:** Pay attention to the sequence of colors and sounds played by Simon.
3. **Repeat:** Click on the colors in the same order as Simon played them.
4. **Level Up:** Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another step to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging.
5. **Game Over:** If you make a mistake, the game will end. You can then restart by pressing the "Start" button again.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS:** For styling the elements and providing visual effects.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, and generating sounds.
